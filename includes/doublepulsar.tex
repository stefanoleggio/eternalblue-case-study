Before talking about the complete working exploit is it important to spend a few words regarding the payload used by EternalBlue.\\
As anticipated in the introduction, this was also created by the NSA for short term monitoring in Windows systems.
It is an advanced payload which is installed in the RAM memory, for that is for "short term monitoring", and it runs in a kernel mode. It opens a backdoor using the SMB port and service, this increments 
the difficulty of detection.\\
It will be installed and executed in the HAL's heap with full privileges, this will gain the full control of the system to the attacker.
